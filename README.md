# Project SageMaker Deployment

This is part of Udacity Deep Learning Program, and this repository is meant to document my progress towards sagemaker deployment project completion.

In this project, I got familiar with AWS SageMaker, trained sentiment analysis model with sagemaker api, and deployed model for a web application. 

## Steps
- Data Downloading and Pre-processing
- Upload processed data to AWS S3
- Build and train models with AWS SageMaker
- Deploy model endpoint and test model
- Deploy model endpoint for web application and test model


## Dependencies
PyTorch is the deep learning framework used in this project (model construction), however SageMaker notebook environment is used and PyTorch has been pre-installed, hassle-free.
